1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Answer: To create maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs, I focus on modularity and reusability. In Project One, I built a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Python module, which streamlined Project Two by connecting dashboard widgets to the database through a single, centralized function set. This approach reduced redundancy, ensured consistency, and simplified debugging, as any changes only needed to be made in one place. It also enhanced scalability, enabling quick feature additions without rewriting database logic. Adaptable for future projects, this CRUD module saves time and increases reliability across applications like reporting tools or web apps, building efficient and flexible code for current and future needs.

3. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Answer: As a computer scientist, I approach problems systematically: I begin by thoroughly understanding requirements, breaking down tasks, and designing modular, reusable solutions. For Grazioso Salvare’s database and dashboard, I analyzed specific data needs and prioritized a modular, scalable design with distinct components for each function, like data retrieval and display, allowing for focused testing and easy updates. Unlike theoretical coursework, this project required real-world adaptability and client focus, so I built a system anticipating future data or feature expansions. In the future, I’d enhance this approach by engaging clients early to clarify requirements, using iterative development to gather feedback, and applying modular database design principles to ensure robust, adaptable solutions for evolving client needs.

3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Answer: Computer scientists create solutions that optimize processes, improve decision-making, and enable innovation through technology. They analyze problems, design algorithms, and develop systems that transform raw data into actionable insights. This work matters because it drives efficiency, accuracy, and scalability for businesses in almost every field.

For a company like Grazioso Salvare, my work on a database and dashboard system could greatly enhance their operations. By streamlining data management and making critical information accessible in real-time, they can make faster, more informed decisions, allocate resources better, and respond quickly to changes. Ultimately, computer science work empowers companies to be more agile and effective in achieving their goals.
